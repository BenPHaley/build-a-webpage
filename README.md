# Build-A-Webpage
------------

## Goal
------------
To combine the knowledge I learned over Winter break into a functional
website. Use *HTML*, *CSS*, *PHP*, and *Javascript* to develop an interactive
webpage that exhibits my talents as a programmer.

## Files
------------
- views.py - links the multiple *HTML* pages to each other and the *CSS*
program
- **templates**
    - home.html - the home page of the webpage. Has a navigation bar allowing
    the user to easily move between each part of my webpage.
    - about.html - short bio of Ben Haley
    - signin.html - a basic form allowing a user to input a username and
    password
    - authorize.php - *PHP* program that validates user input from signin.html
- **static\css**
    - first_style.css - the style sheet for all of the html pages. Helps
    create the navigation bar and makes the page look more professional.
- **static\images**
    - A folder that holds all of the images used on the website
